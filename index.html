   <h3> Steel Mills in the Mon Valley in Allegheny County</h3>
 
<h3>Rationale</h3><

<ol><h3>

<li>I grew up in Glassport, a small town south of Pittsburgh. Glassport is in the region known as the Mon Valley, the valley where the Monongahela River (Mon River) flows. The Mon River flows north from West Virginia through southwestern Pennsylvania, to Pittsburgh where it merges with the Allegheny River to form the Ohio River.</li>
    
    <li>During the Industrial Revolution, steel mills were built all along the Mon River. This is partially because of geography. West Virginia and Western Pennsylvania have significant deposits of coal. Coal was shipped in barges on the Mon River, where it was offloaded for use in the mills. You can still see this at the Clairton Coke Works, which is one of the few mills still open.</li>

    <li>As you can see in the map below, mills were all along the river. In fact, I grew up in a house less than six blocks away from the Bucyrus-Erie plant.</li>

    <li>Life in these towns along the Mon River revolved around the mills. Many boys would either drop out of high school or graduate then get a job in one of the mills.</li>
    
    <li>Generations of families worked in the mills. If you take my family as an example, both my great-grandfather and grandfather worked at Copperweld and I had uncles who worked at National Tube and Bucyrus-Erie.</li>

    <li>In the late 70’s and early 80’s, the industry collapsed. Most of these mills shut down. Unemployment skyrocketed in the region, and many families had to leave the area.  </li>
    
   <li>When I’ve tried to explain how important the steel industry was in the Pittsburgh area, many people don’t understand how intertwined the mills were with life in the region. This map is a way of trying to explain this.
    </li>
</h3></ol>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ol><h3>
<li>These were not the only steel mills in the Pittsburgh area. There were mills further south along the Mon River and also along the Allegheny River north of the city. However, I wanted to focus on this region because of the concentration of mills here. </li>

<li>I’ve tried to include a photo of each mill. I haven’t been able to find photos for all of them.</li>

<li>Finding geographical coordinates for buildings that no longer exist, and, in some cases, haven’t existed for decades was a challenge.</li>

            <p>This plant, which was known as Copperweld Steel at one point, was located in Glassport.</p>

            <p>It produced, among other things, copper wiring, copper conductors, and reinforcement for embankments and walls in flood control. In 1976, it was bought by a French company, Societe Imetal. </p>
            
            <p>Copperwled opened in Glassport in 1927 and closed in 1983. Its office building has sicne been torn down and a pharmacy is now on that property. The factory space is now a small business incubator.</p>

            <p>This plant was also located in Glassport. It was originally the Pittsburgh Steel Foundry, or just the Foundry. This mill produced casting of various sizes. It also changed hands a few times. In 1974, the mill was bought by Bucyrus-Erie. At this point, the plant continued to produce casting, but those casting were now primarily for the fossil fuel industries, as the United States was teying to increase production of those after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis">The Oil Embargo of 1973-4.</a></p>
       
            <p>This plan began operations as the Pittsburgh Steel Foundry in 1899. After a merger, it changed its name to Pittron in 1927. It was bought by Bucyrus-Erie in 1974. It closed in 1981. It has since been torn down.</p>

            <p>The Tube Works was a US Steel plant, located in McKeesport. As the name implies, it specialized in making tubes. It was also called Tube City.</p>
        
            <p>Tube City opened in 1902 and closed in 1984. Part of this space is a small business incubator now.</p>
